# ai-features (Mental Health Logic & Trend Analysis)

Design and experimentation space for AI-assisted features in the
**Patient Management & Mental Health Tracker** platform.

Intended responsibilities (future work):
- Define mental health check-in schemas and scoring approaches
- Analyze trends in mood, sleep, energy, and engagement over time
- Raise risk flags / alerts that can surface in the doctor dashboard

Currently this folder contains **only placeholders and documentation comments**.
There is **no real AI/ML model or production logic** implemented.

## Suggested Tech Stack (choose later)

You can choose Python or another language suitable for data analysis and ML, for example:
- Python + NumPy / Pandas / scikit-learn / PyTorch / TensorFlow

## Files

- `main.py` – placeholder entry point for AI / analytics prototypes
- `requirements.txt` – placeholder dependency list for Python-based work

## Next Steps

1. Define data structures for check-ins and derived features.
2. Start with simple rules-based scoring and trend detection.
3. If needed, iterate toward ML-based models (carefully, with domain experts).
4. Expose results to the backend via a clean interface or service boundary.
