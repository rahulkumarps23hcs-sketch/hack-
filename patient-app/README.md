# patient-app (Patient Mobile App)

Mobile frontend for the **Patient Management & Mental Health Tracker** platform.

This app is intended for patients to:
- Record daily physical and mental health check-ins
- View basic history and trends
- Receive reminders for medication and appointments

At this stage, this folder only contains **structure and placeholders**.
No real UI, navigation, or business logic is implemented yet.

## Suggested Tech Stack (choose later)

You can plug in any mobile stack you prefer, for example:
- React Native / Expo
- Flutter
- Native Android / iOS

## Files

- `index.js` – placeholder entry point for the mobile app
- `package.json` – minimal project metadata and placeholder scripts

## Next Steps

1. Pick your mobile framework.
2. Replace `index.js` with the actual app bootstrap file.
3. Add real dependencies and scripts to `package.json`.
4. Connect to the backend API defined in `../backend`.
