# doctor-dashboard (Doctor Web Dashboard)

Web frontend for clinicians and care teams in the **Patient Management & Mental Health Tracker** platform.

This dashboard is intended to let doctors:
- View patient lists and basic profiles
- Monitor physical and mental health trends
- See risk flags and alerts from `ai-features`
- Add notes and plan follow-ups

Currently this folder contains only **structure and placeholders**.
No real UI components, routing, or business logic exists yet.

## Suggested Tech Stack (choose later)

You can choose any modern web stack, for example:
- React + Vite
- Next.js
- Vue / Nuxt

## Files

- `index.js` – placeholder entry point for the web dashboard
- `package.json` – minimal project metadata and placeholder scripts

## Next Steps

1. Pick your web framework.
2. Replace `index.js` with your actual app entry (e.g., `src/main.jsx`, `pages/_app.tsx`).
3. Add real dependencies and build scripts to `package.json`.
4. Integrate with the backend API (`../backend`).
